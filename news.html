	<p>A balanced, clear, and comprehensive report of events/legal actions that took place leading up the date of publication. If you don’t read any other articles, read this one!
Covers incidents of sexual abuse/assault, the legal saga, and the smear campaign against Charlotte/how she was blacklisted, as well as how powerful hollywood players have attempted to portray Kirk, Newton, and Marshall as “extortionists” 
TW for mentions of sexual assault. There is a description of sexual assault beginning in the 4th paragraph. If you don’t want to read this, stop reading at “little has been reported about the night in question” (the 5th line in the 4th paragraph) and continue at the start of the 6th paragraph, which begins “those details hearken.”
